# Blockchain Web Interface

This project contains a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger allows partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger. 


## *Technologies*

**Programming Language** 
- Python

**Libraries** 
- Streamlit, DataClasses, Typing, Datetime, Pandas, Hashlib


## *Installation Guide*

1.First make sure Anaconda is installed, then activate conda dev. 

- [Install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html)

- To run the main application you will need to activate the anaconda 'dev' environment in your terminal, you can activate the one included with Anaconda: 

                conda activate dev

- If you do not have a 'dev' environment or don't know, type and enter the following. You will still use the previous steps' command to activate:

            conda create -n dev python=3.7 anaconda

2.Ensure necessary libraries are installed on your operating machine, list of required libraries in Libraries section       


## *Usage*

- To use the application, in your terminal navigate to the directory where the cloned "pychain.py" file is located. Then simply:

            streamlit run pychain.py
